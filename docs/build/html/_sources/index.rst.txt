DeepTrees is a PyTorch-based library for end-to-end tree crown segmentation and analysis in multispectral remote sensing imagery. 

Highlights:
	-	User-friendly, flexible, and GPU-optimized for efficiency.
	-	Supports 4-channel imagery (RGBi) with built-in PyTorch data loaders.
	-	Simple API for training and evaluating U-Net-based tree segmentation and distance transform models.
	-	Generates pixel-entropy maps for active learning and fine-tuning.
	-	Computes vegetation indices, tree crown health and allometric metrics.
	-	Pre-trained models and sample labeled datasets for DOP imagery in Central Germany.
	-	Easily configurable via a YAML file.
	-	Integration of Geospatial Foundation Model (GeoFM) backbones.
	-	Tree species classification and height estimation models.


DeepTrees is a result of the `DeepTrees <https://deeptrees.de>`_ project, a collaboration between the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research -- UFZ and the Helmholtz AI initiative.

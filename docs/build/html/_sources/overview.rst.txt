Architectural Overview
======================

DeepTrees realeases started with version 1.0.0 because it is a fork of the TreeCrownDelineation (TCD) library that has been highly restructured and extended to a full PyTorch-based library for a more general use of the software for model training, feature extraction, evaluation, predictions, and analysis. DeepTrees especially focuses on the analysis part as the authors believe that current deep learning implementations for tree crown detection do not provide comprehensive metrics for downstream applications in ecology, forestry, urban planning and biodiversity research.
The TCD library was developed by Maximillian Freudenberg et al. at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and can be found at: `https://github.com/AWF-GAUG/TreeCrownDelineation <https://github.com/AWF-GAUG/TreeCrownDelineation>`_.
